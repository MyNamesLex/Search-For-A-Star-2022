## DiceSweeper

(Made with the Unity Game Engine using C#)

### What was my task for this game jam?

I was given a starter project which was a very bare bones version of minesweeper in 2D. I was tasked with adding and improving the game whilst keeping the core concept of minesweeper.

### Results

The results of this game jam and the game itself can be found <a href="https://itch.io/jam/games-programming-challenge-2022/rate/1344072">here</a> 

### What I Learned

I learned a lot from this game jam due to the detailed feedback from the Judge, the downside's to this game is that it is difficult to remember what each dice effect does. The judge then later states that icons to represent the effects would help. Although this is a good solution i believe the fault with the hard-to-learn aspect of the game lies with the dice effects and the effects themselves more then the explanation aspect. I think they should be simplified more and should be limited to one simple or short none-complicated sentence to explain what they do, along with an icon that displays what number it landed on and the popup that when the dice lands that displays what number it has landed on should also state what the effect did also.

This hard-to-learn aspect also impacted another game of mine called <a href="https://mynameslex.itch.io/lock-and-key">Lock and Key</a> but in a different aspect, the game is simple where you destroy the envionment to find a key to progress to a random level. Then the level you were just on resets as the player gets teleported to the randomly chosen level and this cycle continues infinitly. I was wanting to do a more laid back and relaxing game than what I have done prior to this. But however, the explanation text that is right infront of the player as the game loads was slightly to the right and just off screen for most people which i realised in this <a href="https://youtu.be/y_h8adNF3PE?t=1191">livestream.</a> 

Using the knowledge from the livestream of Lock and Key I made the information on how to play to the user as easy to read and as noticeable as possible by having a how to play button on the main menu and a staggered text entrance to the game when the player presses start that explains how the game works. What I did wrong here was I presented the player with too much information at once and overwhelmed the player with too much information that was long and a block of text. What I should of done was a tutorial level which is played from the start button which slowly introduces the player to the game without making it overly apparent that it is a tutorial, keep the text blocks to a minimum and dice effects to one simple or short none-complicated sentence like I did with dice effects 1 and 6.

Moving forward I've learned to take into consideration more how a game is played by others and how to better convey to the user how to play and how to keep a game as simple and as easy to play as possible.
